# File Storage Orchestration

The goal of this repository is containing a docker-compose file which will be in charge of running the applications of the system: A [File Storage Service](https://github.com/javierseixas/file-storage-service) (server), and a [File Storage UI Client](https://github.com/javierseixas/file-storage-ui-client).

## Requirements
You'll need **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for running both applications.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `docker-compose up`
3. Once both containers are running, you can go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for accessing the React client
4. Hope you like it!

## More Info
You'll find specific information about each application in its own repository:

* [File Storage Service](https://github.com/javierseixas/file-storage-service)
* [File Storage UI Client](https://github.com/javierseixas/file-storage-ui-client)
